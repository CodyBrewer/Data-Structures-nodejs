Common data structures created using javasript
 
 - Singly Linked List
  - A list of nodes that hold a value and a pointer value that points to the next value in the list
 - Doublylinked list
  - A list of nodes that hold a value, a pointer value that points to the previous value, and a pointer value that points to the next value in the list
 - Stack
  - A list of nodes that adds nodes to the top of the list, an example is a stack of pancakes. You start with the pancake at the top even thought the first one was a the bottom. LIFO (last in first out)
 - Queue
  - A list of nodes that adds nodes to the back of the queue and removes the nodes at the front fo the queue. An example of this is a line of people waiting at a right, the first person in line is the first person on the right and the last person in the line is the last person on the ride. FIFO(first in, first out)
- Binary Search Tree:
  - A Tree of nodes who point to a node to the left if the value of the node to the left is less than the value of the node and a node that points to the right if the value of the node is greater than or equal to the current node value.
